# NBA Free Throw Accuracy
Through data  visualizations, this project analyzes NBA player statistics from the 1997-98 season to the 2021-22 season. Specifically, which factors affect player's free throw accuracy and how such accuracy rate influences their opportunities to become MVPs.

# NBA Free Throw Accuracy Analysis

**Understanding how various factors influence free throw performance and its correlation with MVP status in the NBA.**

[cite_start]This project investigates NBA player statistics from the 1997-98 to the 2021-22 seasons to analyze factors affecting free throw accuracy and its relationship with a player's chance of becoming an MVP[cite: 1, 3, 5].

## Key Insights:

* [cite_start]**Positional Influence:** Point Guards and Shooting Guards generally exhibit higher free throw accuracy compared to Centers and Power Forwards[cite: 136].
* [cite_start]**Attempts vs. Accuracy:** Surprisingly, a higher number of free throw attempts tends to correlate with a slight decrease in overall accuracy[cite: 140].
* [cite_start]**MVP Correlation:** Players who achieve MVP status tend to be more accurate and score more points from free throws compared to non-MVP players, with a noticeable difference in average free throw points[cite: 112, 113, 143].

## Key Technologies Used:

* **R**
* **ggplot2** (for data visualization)
* **dplyr** (for data manipulation)

**1. Relationship Between Position and Free Throw %**
![Relationship Between Position and Free Throw %](image_position.png)
[cite_start]*This violin plot illustrates the distribution of free throw percentages across different player positions, revealing trends in accuracy[cite: 38, 39, 50].*

**2. Density Plot of Free Throw Distribution (MVP vs. Non-MVP)**
